				<p>
					Hey! So you're curious to know more about me. Read on, and I'll tell you.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm currently living in the Chicago-area metro - and offering my services as a software consultant,
					interface designer, and event planner - but mostly, I'm looking to provide the first two. 
				</p>
				<img src="images/nicholas_small.jpg" class="floatRight">
				<p>
					I've been working on the web professionally since 2004, when I launched Bobby Horton.com. I've continued to
					build, deploy, and optimize web applications for many clients since then. I'm well versed in Ruby (and Rails), PHP,
					Python, and Javascript. Most recently, I worked with Mad Mimi, an email marketing startup. In a short five month 
					period, we were able to dramatically increase performance, and increase the number of users - on both the site 
					and API.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2005, I launched a podcast that quickly rose to popularity thanks to the iTunes Podcast directory. Though that show
					is no longer on the air, I retained my love for podcasting - going on to launch <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/themachinepodcast">The Machine</a>, a show featuring the best
					and brightest independent music from artists around the world. (The podcast website is being reconstructed at the moment.) 
					I'm also currently offering my voice-over services as the co-host of the popular <a href="http://mothpod.com" target="_blank">Mothpod</a> podcast.
				</p>
				<p>
					After moving to Chicago in June, 2010 - I started laying plans for the <a href="http://chicago-geek-breakfast.gathers.us/" target="_blank">Chicago Geek Breakfast</a> - a monthly gathering of
					photographers, software developers, designers, and researchers. Now in it's fourth month, the group grows with every meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not writing code, planning events, recording a podcast, or consulting with clients - you'll find me 
					enjoying craft beer or artisan spirits, reading, or exploring the great city where I live.

				<h2>Quick Hits</h2>
				<p>
					A few questions designed to help you get acquainted with who I am.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What is your web development framework of choice?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					It depends on what I'm building. For most projects, I find Ruby on Rails works the best. It's eloquent, well-established, and allows me to quickly deliver working software.
				</p>
				<p>
					That said, both developers and consumers are demanding more from their online experience - and I see myself using platforms like Node.js (a light and fast way to write server-side applications in javascript) more in the future. (I'm currently working with Node on one project, and absolutely loving it.)
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What's your preferred editor?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Ah, another geek in the crowd. Well, from one geek to another - I love VIM. No - before you ask, I don't want to discuss eMacs.) Wanna see my current <a href="http://github.com/nicholaswyoung/dotvim" target="_blank">VIM configuration</a>?
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>How important is validation, when writing HTML?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					While important, validation isn't the gold standard for evaluating anyone's markup. Don't get me wrong, every site I write validates in pure HTML5. However, we're still in an environment where certain "hacks" are required to support certain (often legacy) browsers. These workarounds may prevent markup from validating properly - but the markup may render as desired in all browsers despite failing validation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The biggest question is - how important is support for legacy browsers? This is a question I'll ask in the beginning, and we'll move forward accordingly.
				</p>
