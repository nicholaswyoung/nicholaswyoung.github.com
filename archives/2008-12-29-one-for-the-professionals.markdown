title: One for the Professionals
---

Preface: I have lots of intelligent friends who engage the world daily on the internet. This is in no way meant to discourage or belittle what they do, but - if you're a iPhone-toting, twitter-browsing "social media strategist,"  or "internet marketing professional," be warned... I've set the crosshairs of this post dead on you.

<strong>The Backstory</strong>

Let me begin by noting that I'm the king of the fools. That's right - this post will probably be sprinkled with hypocrisy, so I'm warning you now. During the formative days of the internet, it was difficult to connect with others, mainly due to the financial, and technological barriers. If you weren't tech-savvy, good luck on getting connected. Growing up, much of the United States' population had already experienced the power of the internet - but I still consider myself a child of that generation. 

In those days, my technological prowess was limited, and my hometown was small and often overlooked, until a local telephone company decided to bring the internet to us. My interest in all things digital immediately piqued, and I began what would become a lifelong pursuit. Beginning with handwritten HTML (running on a networked Windows box), and progressing to knowledge in almost 10 languages, you could say I've been around the block, at least once. But, please keep in mind, this post is anything - except about me.

<strong>The Problem</strong>

Over the past few years, products and services like Blogger, Twitter, Wordpress, and Friendfeed have matured, and reached incredible adoption rates, even among older demographics. I guess the need to connect brings out the early-adopter in all of us. However, as these services grew, many marketing professionals sought to reach the communities created by social networking sites. This desire birthed a generation of internet entrepreneurs - who possessed neither the will, information, or skill to correctly pursue their career path. 

Visit any social networking site, and look around. In the span of a few minutes, you're likely to uncover five or more. You'll know them by: excessive twittering (typically about their long flight to Silicon Valley, or another prestigious location), pleas for sponsorship (which they wouldn't need if they weren't in the air most of the time), their huge number of followers, a blog, almost always bearing a marketing-related brand of some sort. Remember, if we subscribe to what they say, we've completely ignored any pluses of Twitter, or any other communication medium. If I choose to connect with you, it's because I care about your opinions. You may not like me, and that's a risk I take willingly. I also allow open debate on any topic, and that includes this one. 

<strong>The Solution</strong>

The previous paragraph was harsh, and I know it. I'll probably lose followers over what I said. But, if you're angry now, that's good. If we communicate regularly, you probably agree with me, and also know that when a problem is identified, I almost always post a solution as well. This is no exception.

Living in Nashville, I can't help but notice the ruins of an industry gone awry. Greedy hands built, and destroyed the business that sustained our city's economy for years. Many residents still work daily at their desk jobs, dreaming of a career in music, complete with the limo, and a worldwide tour slot - something that they'll never have. Smart musicians are choosing to market themselves, and learn whatever skills are necessary, or work with one-stop marketing and design firms - a concept that many social media professionals need to learn about.

Just like the .com bubble, the hype that surrounds social media gods will burst in 2009. Watch it. When it bursts, those who are willing to learn and flex will profit, while most, with their limited skill sets, won't be able to compete. My advice to you is learn everything. If you're running a default template for your website, redesign it. If you're blogging and twittering, go speak in public (with your audible voice.)  2009 is the year for maturity. Embrace it. The only way to learn is to do, and yeah - you'll never be a professional. I'm not one, and you won't be either. There's too much to learn. Get over it.
