title: Connecting the Dots
---

For several months now, I've pondered where, and how to begin the reassembly of our country's economic foundation. The insiders knew that the system would one day topple, but did nothing to slow, or stop it. Though as a nation we were blinded to the truth, there were however, some who saw the harsh reality - but either weren't in a position of power, or simply didn't have all the answers. At this point, however, pointing fingers at anybody isn't going to help. Instead, we need to carefully analyze what went wrong, and try to lay precautions into the foundation as we rebuild. In many ways, dealing with the economy is much like a children's puzzle, hence the title of this post. In the text ahead, I'm going to lay out a theory I've had for several months. I'm anything but an economist, so it's open for discussion and debate. Trust me, your thoughts are welcome.

<strong>So, what's the problem?</strong>
Let me be real. The problem is big business. Over the course of the years, these corporate behemoths have grown larger and fatter, until they control so much of the capital in our economic system. The fact that many of them deal in financial securities doesn't help matters at all. You see, whoever controls the flow of capital, controls the economy. That's capitalism, pure and simple. You do well, you rise to the top. But, as the system dictates, when you mismanage, or otherwise fail, you fall. When you fall, your collapse allows opportunistic entrepreneurs to fill your market.  The problem today is, these giants aren't doing well at all, yet they don't fall. The government shouldn't prop them up, if we are to ever recover.

<strong>But, that's so evil!</strong>
Well, maybe it is. On the other hand, you had better start counting, because there's far more evil things at work around you right now. See, my company is doing just fine. I'm small enough to not really notice when the titans rattle their swords, clash, and die. Probably part of the key to my success is living in a city of creative individuals, and having access to the internet. My clientele is everyone, everywhere - and, unlike the big names, I'm approachable. Find me on twitter, and we'll have a one-on-one conversation. I'll make time for that.

<strong>So, what's the solution?</strong>
Ok, so I lied. There's not just a solution. You can't fix this overnight, and it takes more than 15 minutes to bake. However, if we can change our mindset, going forward, we're going to be safer than ever.

With the government propping up the aforementioned unsuccessful institutions, it's obvious that our economic system cannot function properly. The clog, ironically, is comprised entirely of taxpayer greenbacks. With the clogged pipes as they are, the only possible fix is to do something that we, those in the small business sector have mastered, something that most companies have long since forgotten: service. Think of this as a mild laxative for constipated capitalism.

For now, all we can do is connect with other independent doers, form networks to service our clients, and focus on customer care, appreciation, and timely task completion. At it's core, business has always been about relationships, and that's not just a hundred years ago; It's true today, more than ever.

So, whether you're running solo or working in a co-op, if you're adhering to the suggestions above, know that you're part of the solution. The more that small businesses If you're not running your own show, I encourage you to give it a try. Now is the time to break away, and follow your dream... and hey, if your dream happens to be part of the solution, then that's even better.
