That aside, I loved Bobby's music well before we were even thinking about working together. </em>

There's no need to refresh the page. It isn't an error, and you did read the tagline right. From the files of "I can hardly believe this is working" comes a new and refreshing campaign that I'm working on with recording artist <a href="http://bobbyhorton.com" target="_blank">Bobby Horton</a>. Having contributed large amounts of music to the films of Ken Burns, you might think Bobby would be household name by now. Wrong - he's still working through niche marketing channels, and has successfully done so since 1985.

As an independent musician, Bobby works three main gigs: film score composition, live shows, and selling his own releases. Composing music generally keeps him busy, but in years past, he's recorded 10 volumes of authentic music from the American Civil War: 6 from the Southern Confederacy, and 4 from the Union. In addition, there is christmas music, and songs from the American Revolution to be had. This might be a tad tedious, but you must understand the backstory if you are to grasp what I'm trying to say.

We built Bobby's first website roughly 4 years ago, and even at the time, it was primitive; however, considering that we came from nothing, anything was an improvement. The site instantly skyrocketed to 500 daily pageviews, a number unheard of on any new web space. From 2006 through the end of 2007, we rarely updated it. Still, his grassroots marketing continued to pay. The hits never dropped, in fact, they continued to rise - and as they rose - the demand for a more interactive website became clear. We moved to the <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> publishing platform early this year, and have experienced overwhelming participation from Bobby's audience. 

Not long after our move to a dynamic publishing platform, Bobby <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bobby-Horton/35175739561" target="_blank">signed up for facebook</a>. Now, just a short month later, fan numbers are already in the triple digits - and I haven't even started promotion there yet. Add to this his rising play count on <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/bobby+horton" target="_blank">last.fm</a>, and we've almost got the perfect storm. Consider our big traditional media push is coming soon, and all doubts are extinguished - we have brought an artist out of virtual obscurity, and fully developed him as a person, meshing all three lives, and their related marketplaces.

What can we learn from this? Social interaction is your friend, but so is perseverance. This game can take years to play, but if each move is properly executed, and you have a solid product, it will always be a success. Game on.
