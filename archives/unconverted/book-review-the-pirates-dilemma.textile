I don't read much, but what printed materials I do purchase and read tend to be of a certain caliber. I like books that make you think, and Matt Mason's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141653220X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nichyoun-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=141653220X" target="_blank">The Pirate's Dilemma: How Youth Culture is Reinventing Capitalism</a> does just that.

If you've read it, I would love to hear your thoughts. If you haven't, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141653220X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nichyoun-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=141653220X" target="_blank">go get it</a> for just over $10 new at Amazon. I assure you, there's more than $10 worth of advice inside.
