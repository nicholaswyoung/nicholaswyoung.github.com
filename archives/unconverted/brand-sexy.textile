Two days ago, I walked out of the post office to find a young lady stepping out of her car. Had her apparel not been so unique, I wouldn't have noticed anything special, and simply got in my car and left. Now, with all courtesy to the wearer, this lady wasn't anything special, she was simply caught up in culture, and I took notice.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-694" title="Hollister" src="http://nicholaswyoung.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/19858_01_253_x.jpg" alt="Hollister" width="253" height="253" />

"Hollister", read the text emblazoned on front of her bright-pink babydoll tee. For the uninitiated, this national clothing brand is known for it's Californian attitude, and ranks alongside companies like American Apparel and Ambercrombie, with each competing for the same teen market.

If nothing else, teens want to seen as sexy by their peers, and nothing screams that message louder (to them) than a model lounging around in a provocative pose with <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/anf/lifestyles/html/photogallery.html" target="_blank">his shirt unbuttoned</a>.Â We all know that he wasn't out working when he got that sweaty, and in reality, the deodorant is probably struggling to keep up with his growing odor - but who cares - every post-pubescent boy has gotta have that shirt. This is how these clothing brands established themselves.

Fast forward six-months, and if your brand is selling well, you can begin to transform it into an icon. Sure, you probably wouldn't sell many awkwardly labeled t-shirts right out of the gate, but now, your name is a status symbol. It's sexy. You essentially have customers who aren't volunteering to be part of your marketing, but rather paying for a shirt with your name on it. Why? Because you made a connection, and provided a way for every one of them to look good.

So, the next time you gear up for a marketing pitch, remember this. Identify with who your customers want to be, and provide a call to action.
