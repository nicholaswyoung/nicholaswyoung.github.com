Maybe you're one of those who think customer service is dead, or perhaps youre just fed up with the financial turmoil, I suggest you give Avenue Bank a try. With two locations, one in downtown Nashville in Cummins Station, and another on West End Ave, they're quite accessible, no matter where you are in the metro area. But, to me the real draw isn't their location. It's the customer service.

With each account, they send a handwritten note thanking the account holder for their business. Everytime you walk in, they greet you by name, and even assign a banker to you. Here, tellers as we know them, are a thing of the past.

Inside both locations, the atmosphere is great, quite different from what you will experience at other banks. While they must acknowledge the upheaval in their industry, it's obvious that they are there for the customers. When I put my money in, I know it will be there years from now. They don't need a bailout to continue operations, and I certainly don't see them failing anytime soon.

So, if you're looking for something different, pay my friends at <a href="http://avenuenashville.com" target="_blank">Avenue Bank</a> a visit. They're the first company that I've found in a long time that lives up to their motto: "the difference is real."
