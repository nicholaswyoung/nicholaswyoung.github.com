Across the country, knowledge is being shared, friendships are being formed, and businesses started, thanks to small gatherings of passionate individuals. One such gathering, Podcamp Boston 4, was this past weekend, and if the photos that came out afterwards are any indication, I would say it was everything I described rolled into one event.

Though I've only been in the Barcamp/Podcamp scene for the last few years, I can say that these gatherings are vital to a community's progress. If you, and those around you want to move forward, I suggest either finding a gathering that you can attend regularly, or start your own.

The act of trading knowledge with another human being is natural. Just let it happen, and don't worry about being competitive for once.
