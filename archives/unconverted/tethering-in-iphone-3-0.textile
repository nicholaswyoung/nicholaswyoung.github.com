<strong>Update &amp; Clarification: Jailbreaking your phone is not required.</strong>

Think you have to wait until AT&amp;T officially supports tethering on your iPhone? If you said yes, I'd be asking you what year it is. We're in 2009 now, and the internet is a perfect source of information you aren't supposed to have.

During WWDC, Phil Schiller confirmed that tethering was part of the feature pack for iPhone OS 3.0 - so we know the platform is capable - it's all about exploiting the proper weakness, right? Fortunately, CrunchGear has a <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/06/17/enable-tethering-in-iphone-30/" target="_blank">great how-to</a> up, or if you're just lazy and want a one-click solution, point your iPhone's browser <a href="http://help.benm.at/help.php" target="_blank">here</a>. It's that easy.

After you've executed the hack, navigate to settings -&gt; general -&gt; network -&gt; internet tethering. Rock on.
