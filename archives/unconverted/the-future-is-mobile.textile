For years, we've been taught that media must be created and distributed by large corporations in well-lit studios with large budgets. Not anymore.

The video you see above was supposedly shot using only an iPhone 3GS. I don't know what was used for editing, but it was definitely decent.

With the power of quality video in the palm of your hand, what does it mean for network TV providers? I doubt that they will continue to be the main source of news, but the accuracy of citizen journalism is still questionable. What's your opinion?
