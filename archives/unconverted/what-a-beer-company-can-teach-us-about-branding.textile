What was once a one-way street, now boasts space for bidirectional traffic. However, despite the obvious barriers, some companies have been communicating with their employees and fans for years - and though I've sought a company to use as an example for several months now - my search yielded it's first fruit just last weekend.

Friday night, I sat at my laptop writing <a href="http://rubylang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and sipping on a chilled bottle of <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/1554" target="_blank">1554</a>, an "enlightened black ale," from <a href="http://newbelgium.com" target="_blank">New Belgium</a> brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado. As I downed the last sip, I carefully rolled the bottle in my hands, reading the label line-by-line, until one phrase stood out:
<blockquote>"We'd love to have you stop by the brewery! - Jeff &amp; Kim"</blockquote>
How's that - a personal invitation to visit the facility, from the company's founders. Obviously, they know a thing or two about engaging the customers - and, after all - while 1554 isn't the most expensive beer, it certainly isn't cheap, and attracts a certain caliber of drinker - so they're not inviting the drunkards to stop by. 

If you continue around the label, you'll find out that the brewery is wind-powered and employee owned, that 1554's distinct recipe is the fruit of several researchers' labors, and that the New Belgium website encourages their clientele to extend invitations to one another, with a purpose of drinking great beer together. 

With the advent of digital communications, creating communities around your brand is easier than ever, but folks like New Belgium seem to have well-formed bonds between the founders, employees, and their faithful fans.. They've created a fantastic product, full of passion and hard work, presented it to a group of beer aficionados, who, in turn, share the drink because they love it. It's simple, really. Now, when I sit down to enjoy a great beer, I think of the others around the world who are enjoying the same taste, texture, and smell.

So, what can a community do for your brand? When one fan connects with another, how does that affect their perception of you? I suggest a run to the local grocer. While you're there, pick up a six-pack of 1554, and figure it out.
