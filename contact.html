				<h2>FAQ's</h2>
				<p>
					<b>What do you charge?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hm, it's really hard to say. It depends on the time involved, how big a project is, and frankly - what I'll be doing.
					I know you would really like to know this, and my answer here may be a bit unnerving - but I believe it's best
					if both of us is open. It's best that we discuss your project, and then I'll get in touch with a quote, okay?
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>I've got this awesome idea for a web application! Can you help me build it?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Probably. Let's at least chat about it, and see what I can do. I'm well versed in PHP, Python, Javascript, and Ruby - so if it can be done, I can probably do it. Let's talk, shall we?
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>I spoke with Company A - they said they'll build my site for $500. Can you match that, because I like your work better.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe. As I hope you've seen, I put a lot of work into everything - to make sure you look the best online. Putting your name on a crappy piece of work makes us both look bad (it's kinda like walking out the door half-dressed). But, don't let that stop you from getting in touch.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>I've got an application that's half finished. My developer left - can you finish it?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Good question! I'd love to help, but before either of us dig in, it's best to do what I call a "code review".
					Essentially, we sit down and go over what's finished, and what isn't. We make sure the part that is finished
					has been adequately tested, so we have a strong foundation to build on.
