					<h2>Bobby Horton</h2>
					<p>
						Written entirely in HTML5, Bobby Horton's recently relaunched web presence is a standard bearer for
						several new web technologies. But, you don't have to understand the latest buzzwords to grasp the scope of Bobby's
						work.
					</p>
					<p>
						This critically acclaimed and internationally recognized recording artist is well known for his contributions to the films of Ken Burns (thirteen and counting), sixteen films for the United States Park Service, and two productions on the A&amp;E network.

					<h2>Mad Mimi</h2>
					<p>
						From March though July, 2010 - I worked with Mad Mimi, a email marketing startup focused on making every step - from designing your promotion, to viewing statistics - absolutely delicious.
					</p>
					<p>
						While there, I spearheaded an open source initiative (which yielded several reference quality API libraries in PHP, Python, &amp; Ruby), helped write documentation for users and developers, and along with the rest of our technical team - helped scale the application from 367,323 monthly unique visitors to well over 600,000 - and more than 15 million emails sent daily.

					<h2>Geoff Smith</h2>
					<p>
						Part musician, part producer, but all entrepreneur - Geoff Smith is globally recognized for his jingle work on many notable podcasts (including Adam Curry &amp; John C. Dvorak's "No Agenda"), the unique iPhone ringtone company Ringtone Feeder, and as a successful independent recording artist.
					</p>
					<p>
						In early 2010 - while preparing for the upcoming release of his new album, "That's Gravity" - he asked me to revamp his web presence - creating a design just as interesting as his personality.

						"Heading up customer relations for a company that defines itself by personal interaction with users means it's not enough to work with developers who merely code.
					</p> 
					<p>
						Nicholas has an innate intuition of how people interact with software and it comes across beautifully in the code he writes: sleek, effective and developed to be used by people! It's rare to find a developer who genuinely combines style, substance and sophistication in code. Nicholas does!"
