				<h1>Nicholas Young</h1>
				<h2>producer / broadcaster / photographer / filmmaker</h2>
				<p>
					Iconic photos that capture emotion. Motion pictures that hold your attention with a powerful story.
					Broadcast programs that remind you of radio's golden age. These scenarios are where Nicholas is most at home.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nicholas' voice has been heard by millions around the globe thanks to his adoption of
					podcasting in early 2005, not to mention his numerous appearances on terrestrial radio. And as a 
					photographer, director, and producer, he's had the chance to work with some of best names 
					in independent music - to create striking images, meaningful short-films, documentaries, and
					impactful press materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a seven-year sojourn in the world of professional software development, it's time to 
					bring the old hustle to new markets. With the re-launch of his creative-intelligence firm 
					<a href='http://OriginalMachine.com/' target='_blank'>Original Machine</a>, and the small but mighty 
					<a href='http://Machine.FM' target='_blank'>Machine.FM</a> broadcasting network, his voice - 
					and the voices of friends - are louder than ever.

					&quot;Nicholas' photos are some of the very best to have captured the energy and movement of our band's live performances. They're the kind of photos that make us look better than we probably actually are.&quot;
