					<p>Entrepreneurs are often fired up, and for good reason - they&#8217;re working on something they&#8217;re passionate about. However, it sometimes takes months, or even years for their vision to be realized. In that time, these creative machines are either stuck in a dead end job, or taking various freelance projects to pay the bills while pursuing their dream. Put yourself in that scenario, and it&#8217;s tough to avoid burnout. Over the last year, I&#8217;ve worked many different projects, and gleaned some wisdom that I hope will be valuable to you.</p>
<strong>1. When you connect with someone new, whether they're a client or not, think about how their mission (and if they're a client, your work for them) relates to what you ultimately want to do.</strong>
<p>You never know if that guy or girl across the table is someone very influential, or what your clients do in their spare time. Think about it, and you&#8217;ll be better equipped to move forward when you need references or beta-testers for your product or service.</p>
<strong>2. Live.</strong>
<p>You&#8217;re a creative, and so attending brainstorming sessions can keep your creative juices flowing. I&#8217;m especially guilty here. Don&#8217;t do what I&#8217;ve done, and go into marathon weekend development sessions when you could be out with other people just like you. Balance is crucial.</p>
<strong>3. Build a solid set of rules, and stick to 'em.</strong>
<p>Being a freelancer means you don&#8217;t have the corporate overhead that protects most developers. You&#8217;re exposed to the elements of client pressure, hard deadlines, and fault. That&#8217;s right, even when the customer breaks your code by inputting an endless string of asterisks, it&#8217;s your fault. Setting up solid rules, and sticking to them will make your job easier. Pleasing the customer is important, but keep in mind - you can&#8217;t please everyone.</p>
<strong>4. Be flexible.</strong>
<p>While undercutting yourself isn&#8217;t a great idea (it can kill your self-esteem and willingness to work), sometimes you have to. (Surprisingly, this comes right after setting boundaries, right?) See, there&#8217;s a fine art - knowing when to stick your neck out and be helpful, and when to not. Sometimes you&#8217;ll bend over backwards, and get bit in the ass, and other times, it&#8217;ll pay off. (I&#8217;m still working on learning this one. I&#8217;m far too nice.) </p>
<strong>5. Study hard. It's worth it.</strong>
<p>Know the limitations of both you, and the tools you&#8217;re working with. I can&#8217;t stress this enough. It&#8217;s always better to under promise and over deliver - those invisible brick walls (called expectations) will get you every time.</p>

<p>There, the top 5 ways to freelance, while maintaining your sanity, strength, and vision. I&#8217;d love to hear your comments and suggestions. How to you do it?</p>
