This could cause me to contradict something that I've said in the past, or it may simply reaffirm what I had thought initially. Today, we've encountered the former, so get ready: here comes my pitch in favor of web-based email.

Several years ago when Google released GMail, I knew it would be a game changing e-mail platform, I just didn't know how far it could go in a world that was currently dominated by Hotmail and Yahoo!. Following the release, Google continued to improve the interface, and added features that were previously only accessible in desktop applications. Then, I was committed to using webmail, simply because it allowed me to access my conversations on multiple machines, but later, I found that when running a business, offline retrieval was a must. With that decided, bordering on two years Â ago, I tossed GMail's web interface out the window, in favor of Apple's Mail.app: IMAP made syncing messages a breeze, and I had everything with me when I was on the go. Even after I purchased an iPhone 3G in November of '08 - this was still my preferred method for keeping up with the conversation.

With the release of iPhone OS 3.0, <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/06/17/enable-tethering-in-iphone-30/" target="_blank">I now have internet almost everywhere</a>. Solid, fast, internet. This has caused me to rethink my two-gigabyte-per-mailbox strategy for managing messages in Mail.app, and this morning, I went on the hunt for a better way to manage e-mail. What I found was Mailplane, a small, light app for OS-X that allows you to connect to GMail's web interface through a native application on your Mac.

Though you're still connecting to the web and displaying a page (it's just framed by the app), I've found Mailplane to be incredibly snappy. It supports all of GMail's filing features, and even adds a few of it's own, the most prominent being support for multiple accounts. Switching between mailboxes is easy: just point, and double click. In a nutshell, Mailplane is a simple program that allows you to leverage Google's storage capacity, while maintaining control of your e-mail.

Mailplane sells for $24.95, which is a little pricey for me, considering that Google could pull the plug on GMail, and my investment would be useless. (Maybe there's an open-source application that has similar functionality?) However, you can give it a test run for 30 days, by visiting <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com" target="_blank">MailplaneApp.com</a>. If you try it, let me know your thoughts. After all, this space is all about the conversation.
