I didn't post for the past two days. I moved on Tuesday, and if the process of carting your belongings around doesn't kill you, I guess you're much stronger for it. I suggest that you rest the following day, as I did. Yesterday, it was back to business as usual, and free-time was sparse.

Last night, while visiting the neighborhood pool for the first time, I ran into the nicest, middle-aged chinese couple. They both spoke a bit of english, but unfortunately, I don't speak any chinese. Unless I used simple language, we had reached an impasse.

For the most part, my clients don't speak in my native tongue. Sure, most developers would understand if I walked up and started spouting off about code - but we both live and work in the same space. You see, it's my job to adapt, and speak the client's language. Rather than removing a project from their hands and just doing it, I prefer to bring them along for the ride. If they understand where the project came from, and where it's heading, my chances of success grow exponentially.

So, think about it. Are you speaking your clients' language? If not, try it. The results will surprise you.
