It's almost as if some of them are overwhelmed by the ability to communicate directly with their fans, after years of being told that their fanbase was simply too large for that to happen. Musicians are social beings, even more so than the typical homo sapien; they're constant communicators with deep set emotions that long to break free - and so - they write, they perform, and they share.

Today, I had the pleasure of experiencing a concert by one of my favorite artists, <a href="http://gabedixonband.com" target="_blank">The Gabe Dixon Band</a> - Nashville's formost purveyors of rockin PBD (that's piano, bass, &amp; drums for the uninitiated). Just 40 minutes prior to showtime, Gabe<a href="http://twitter.com/gabedixonband/status/2135749377" target="_blank"> posted a notice</a> on the popular microblogging site, Twitter, where I monitor his "tweets." I returned a note to Gabe, finished up my errands on the opposite end of town, and vowed to be at the stage when the music started.

Months before I was standing in front of the stage, my fianceé was hunting through YouTube videos, looking for something that was anything but musical. Through what may have been a random search result, we were presented with a video of what we dubbed "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlfPqDxESQQ" target="_blank">The Human Piano</a>," which was really the video to the band's single, "Till You're Gone," a playful ditty about two people shacking up together. Sometimes, the catchiest songs are just odd.

Immediately following the show, I chatted with the band, and my fianceé purchased one of their music books. While this case is hardly an example, I can say that time on networking sites is hardly wasted. If ROI is nowhere to be found, you're looking too hard, and you certainly can't put a price on positively impressing someone.
