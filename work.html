					<h2>Geek Out Chicago</h2>
					<p>
						There are many great events in Chicago - the problem is - you don't know about most of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Geek Out Chicago's monthly newsletter keeps you in the loop. Subscribe, and you'll know
						what events are hot, why you should attend, and who will be there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, one social calendar to rule them all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Caution: this project uses experimental technology that
						will probably only work in WebKit-based browsers.

					<h2>Useful HTML5</h2>
					<p>
						HTML5 is here, and as a modern web designer, you can use it now.
					</p>
					<p>
						In late 2010, I was approached by several designers who wanted to increase their marketability
						by learning HTML. The class' curriculum took a zero-to-sixty approach: beginners could know nothing,
						and walk out ready to write beautiful markup and expressive CSS.

					<h2>Stereofeed</h2>
					<p>
						Under development in the Original Machine labs (which are kinda like my skunkworks), I'm quietly working on Stereofeed - a top secret project that, for now, all you know is the name.
					</p>
					<p>
						Curious? Head over to <a href="http://stereofeed.com">Stereofeed.com</a> and register for the mailing list. You'll be the first to know as I get closer to launch.

					<h2>Bobby Horton</h2>
					<p>
						Written entirely in HTML5, Bobby Horton's recently relaunched web presence is a standard bearer for
						several new web technologies. But, you don't have to understand the latest buzzwords to grasp the scope of Bobby's
						work.
					</p>
					<p>
						This critically acclaimed and internationally recognized recording artist is well known for his contributions to the films of Ken Burns (thirteen and counting), sixteen films for the United States Park Service, and two productions on the A&amp;E network.

					<h2>Mad Mimi</h2>
					<p>
						From March though July, 2010 - I worked with Mad Mimi, a email marketing startup focused on making every step - from designing your promotion, to viewing statistics - absolutely delicious.
					</p>
					<p>
						While there, I spearheaded an open source initiative (which yielded several reference quality API libraries in PHP, Python, &amp; Ruby), helped write documentation for users and developers, and along with the rest of our technical team - helped scale the application from 367,323 monthly unique visitors to well over 600,000 - and more than 15 million emails sent daily.

					<h2>Geoff Smith</h2>
					<p>
						Part musician, part producer, but all entrepreneur - Geoff Smith is globally recognized for his jingle work on many notable podcasts (including Adam Curry &amp; John C. Dvorak's "No Agenda"), the unique iPhone ringtone company Ringtone Feeder, and as a successful independent recording artist.
					</p>
					<p>
						In early 2010 - while preparing for the upcoming release of his new album, "That's Gravity" - he asked me to revamp his web presence - creating a design just as interesting as his personality.

					<h2>Shop Belle Meade</h2>
					<p>
						While living in Nashville, Tennessee - I became acquiainted with Belle Meade, one of the neatest townships in Middle-Tennessee.
					</p>
					<p>
						As part of an experiment with hyper-local social networks, and the benefits they offer to consumers and businesses alike - I designed several splash pages for Shop Belle Meade - combining a local marketplace, meeting place for residents, and information for tourists all in one online destination.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I moved away and never launched the site - the concepts I learned while designing were invaluable. A beautiful, yet minimal UI will take you far.

					<h2>Lizzie Keiper</h2>
					<p>
						Before going back to school, digital marketing and media student Lizzie Keiper asked for a fresh redesign of her popular blog - where she talks tech, culture, and literature.
					</p>
					<p>
						I set out to overhaul her dated layout and Wordpress code, taking just over a week from start to finish. We updated Wordpress, designed and coded the theme during the process. Working with Lizzie was excellent - easily one of the best jobs I've ever done.

				"Heading up customer relations for a company that defines itself by personal interaction with users means it's not enough to work with developers who merely code.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Nicholas has an innate intuition of how people interact with software and it comes across beautifully in the code he writes: sleek, effective and developed to be used by people! It's rare to find a developer who genuinely combines style, substance and sophistication in code. Nicholas does!"
